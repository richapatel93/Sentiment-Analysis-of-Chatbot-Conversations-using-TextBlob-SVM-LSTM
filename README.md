# Sentiment Analysis of Chatbot Conversations using TextBlob, SVM & LSTM

## 🎯 Objective

This project demonstrates the application of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for **sentiment analysis** on chatbot conversations. The goal is to compare **rule-based**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** approaches using real and labeled data.

---

## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used

- `TextBlob` – Rule-based sentiment analysis
- `scikit-learn` – LinearSVC classifier with TF-IDF vectorization
- `Keras/TensorFlow` – LSTM model trained on the IMDB dataset
- `Pandas & Matplotlib` – Data manipulation and visualization
- `Google Colab` – Development environment

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Preprocessing and analyzing textual data
- Training and evaluating NLP sentiment models
- Tokenizing and vectorizing text (TF-IDF & Keras tokenizer)
- Building LSTM models for sequence understanding
- Comparing and visualizing multi-model outputs
- Explaining technical results to a non-technical audience

## 📊 Sample Output

| Sentence                                | TextBlob   | LinearSVC | LSTM     |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| "How do I change my flight date?"       | Neutral    | Negative  | Neutral  |
| "I missed my connecting flight."        | Neutral    | Negative  | Negative |
| "Can I add extra baggage?"              | Neutral    | Negative  | Neutral  |

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open each notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `chatbot_data.tsv`
3. Run the cells step-by-step in each notebook: Lab 10, Lab 11, and Lab 12
4. View sentiment predictions and comparison plots

## 📌 Reflection Highlights

- TextBlob is fast and interpretable but limited to surface-level emotion.
- LinearSVC is more scalable but highly dependent on labeled training quality.
- LSTM provided the most balanced and nuanced results, understanding context better.
